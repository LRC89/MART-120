        <p class="content">Today is your day.</p>
        <p class="content">You're off to Great Places!</p>
        <p class="content">You're off and away!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">You have brains in your head.</p>
        <p class="content">You have feet in your shoes.</p>
        <p class="content">You can steer yourself</p>
        <p class="content">any direction you choose.</p>
        <p class="content">You're on your own. And you know what you know.</p>
        <p class="content">And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="content">About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."</p>
        <p class="content">With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,</p>
        <p class="content">you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">And you may not find any</p>
        <p class="content">you'll want to go down.</p>
        <p class="content">In that case, of course,</p>
        <p class="content">you'll head straight out of town.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">It's opener there</p>
        <p class="content">In the wide open air.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">Out there things can happen</p>
        <p class="content">and frequently do</p>
        <p class="content">to people as brainy</p>
        <p class="content">and footsy as you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">And then things start to happen,</p>
        <p class="content">don't worry. Don't stew.</p>
        <p class="content">Just go right along.</p>
        <p class="content">You'll start happening too.</p>
